SMT (Simple Multi-Touch Toolkit) is a project to support the learning of HCI concepts.
It provides an easy to use library for processing sketches to handle touch input and associated matrix and drawing functions, to allow quick development of the desired application.

SMT supports multiple input sources for Touch events:  
* SmartSDK,  
* Windows Touch (requires http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=30679), 
* TUIO, 
* Mouse Emulation, 
* Android, and 
* Leap Motion.

SMT can be used in **Windows**, **Mac** and **Linux** environments.  
  
Installation Instructions:  
&nbsp;&nbsp; **1.**  Install Processing 2.0+ if you do not have it already  
&nbsp;&nbsp; **2.**  Processing Menu bar->sketch->Import Library->Add Library  
&nbsp;&nbsp; **3.**  Search for smt, in the I/O category, click Install  

Online Javadoc is available at http://vialab.github.io/SMT/

See the processing api at http://www.processing.org/reference/ for a complete list and documentation of all available processing functions

If you have problems running SMT, first test that the Processing examples work (File->Examples->Basics), if they do not check the troubleshooting page for solutions (http://wiki.processing.org/w/Troubleshooting).

If you still have problems, please open an issue (https://github.com/vialab/SMT/issues) to report the problems you are having, and we will try our best to fix them promptly.
