SMT (Simple MultiTouch Toolkit) is a project to support the learning of HCI concepts.
It provides an easy to use library for processing sketches to handle touch input and associated matrix and drawing functions, to allow quick development of the desired application.

Online Javadoc is available at http://vialab.github.com/SMT

Steps to use with Processing IDE:
	0. Download latest SMT.zip from https://github.com/vialab/SMT/downloads
	1. Extract the zip file into the libraries folder in the sketchbook folder (The sketchbook folder location can be found via Preferences in the Processing File menu)
	2. (Optional) Download examples.zip from https://github.com/vialab/SMT/downloads
	3. (Optional) Open examples and run them (Sketch->Present for fullscreen)
	3. Create new sketches to learn HCI concepts, create touch capable games, etc

See the processing api at http://www.processing.org/reference/ for a complete list and documentation of all available processing functions

If you have problems running SMT, first test that the Processing examples work (File->Examples), if they do not check the troubleshooting page for solutions(http://wiki.processing.org/w/Troubleshooting).

If you still have problems, please open an Issue (https://github.com/vialab/SMT/issues) to report the problems you are having, and we will try our best to fix them promptly.
