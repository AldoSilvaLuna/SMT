SMT (Simple MultiTouch Toolkit) is a project to support the learning of HCI concepts.
It provides an easy to use library for processing sketches to handle touch input and associated matrix and drawing functions, to allow quick development of the desired application.

Online Javadoc is available at http://vialab.github.com/SMT

The example_sketches_and_libs folder provides some test processing sketches that can be copied to or used as the processing sketchbook location, and the libraries needed in the sketchbook location to run the sketches

Steps to use with Processing IDE:
	0a. Download the source and examples from https://github.com/vialab/SMT
		-if git is installed, clone the repository:
			"git clone https://github.com/vialab/SMT.git"
		-or by clicking the clone button on the github page using: 
			GitHub for Windows (http://windows.github.com) or
 			GitHub for Mac (http://mac.github.com)
		-or by downloading the zip of the source: https://github.com/vialab/SMT/zipball/master
	0b. Download Processing IDE: http://www.processing.org/download/
	1. Copy the libraries folder and optionally the examples folder, from example_sketches_and_libs to your sketchbook folder (The sketchbook folder location can be found via Preferences in the Processing File menu)
	2. Open examples and run them (Sketch->Present for fullscreen)
	3. Edit or create new sketches to learn HCI concepts, create touch capable games, etc

See the processing api at http://www.processing.org/reference/ for a complete list and documentation of all available processing functions
