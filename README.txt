SMT (Simple MultiTouch Toolkit) is a project to support the learning of HCI concepts.
It provides an easy to use library for processing sketches to handle touch input and associated matrix and drawing functions, to allow quick development of the desired application.

The example_sketches_and_libs folder provides some test processing sketches that can be copied to or used as the processing sketchbook location, and the libraries needed in the sketchbook location to run the sketches

Steps to use with Processing IDE:
	0a. Download the source and examples from https://github.com/vialab/SMT:
		-using a git clone of the repository, if git is installed:
			"git clone https://github.com/vialab/SMT.git"
		-by clicking the clone button on the github page, or
		-by downloading the zip of the source
	0b. Download Processing IDE: http://www.processing.org/download/
	1. Open Processing IDE, File->Preferences->Sketchbook location: set this to the example_sketches_and_libs folder that is located where the SMT repository was cloned to
	2. Open examples and run them (Sketch->Present for fullscreen)
	3. Edit or create new sketches to learn HCI concepts, create touch capable games, etc

See the processing api at http://www.processing.org/reference/ for a complete list and documentation of all available processing functions
