SMT (Simple MultiTouch Toolkit) is a project to support the learning of HCI concepts.
It provides an easy to use library for processing sketches to handle touch input and associated matrix and drawing functions, to allow quick development of the desired application.

Online Javadoc is available at http://vialab.github.com/SMT
